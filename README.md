# CPP_Journey

My name is Kyalah Morton. I am graduate student at Baruch College studying real estate. The first language that I studied is C++. I have been coding for a month as of today 29 January, 2023. I am excited to document my coding journey with the world! Follow along with me as I conquer this journey. Through many ups and downs, I will rise to the occassion to learn this language continously!
